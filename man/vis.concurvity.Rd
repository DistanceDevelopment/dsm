\title{Visualise concurvity between terms in a GAM}
\usage{
vis.concurvity(model, type = "estimate")
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{fitted model}

\item{type}{concurvity measure to plot, see \code{\link[mgcv:concurvity]{concurvity}}}
}
\description{
Plot measures of how much one term in the model could be explained by
another. When values are high, one should consider re-running variable
selection with one of the offending variables removed to check for stability
in term selection.
}
\details{
These methods are considered somewhat experimental at this time. Consult
\code{\link[mgcv:concurvity]{concurvity}} for more information on how concurvity
measures are calculated.

\examples{
\dontrun{
library(Distance)
library(dsm)

# load the Gulf of Mexico dolphin data (see ?mexdolphins)
data(mexdolphins)

# fit a detection function and look at the summary
hr.model <- ds(distdata, max(distdata$distance),
               key = "hr", adjustment = NULL)

# fit a simple smooth of x and y to counts
mod1 <- dsm(count~s(x,y)+s(depth), hr.model, segdata, obsdata)

# visualise concurvity using the "estimate" metric
vis.concurvity(mod1)
