\title{Check for autocorrelation in residuals}
\usage{
dsm.cor(
  dsm.obj,
  Transect.Label = "Transect.Label",
  Segment.Label = "Segment.Label",
  max.lag = 10,
  resid.type = "scaled.pearson",
  fun = cor,
  ylim = c(0, 1),
  subset = "all",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dsm.obj}{a fitted dsm object.}

\item{Transect.Label}{label for the transect (default: \code{Transect.Label}).
Using different labels can be useful when transects are split over
geographical features or when transects are surveyed multiple times.}

\item{Segment.Label}{label for the segments (default: \code{Segment.Label}).The
result of calling \code{\link[base:order]{order}} must make sense.}

\item{max.lag}{maximum lag to calculate at.}

\item{resid.type}{the type of residuals used, see
\code{\link{residuals.gam}}. Defaults to \code{"scaled.pearson"} in the GAM
case and \code{"normalized"} in the GAMM case (which are equivalent).}

\item{fun}{the function to use, by default \code{\link[stats:cor]{cor}}, must take two
column vectors as arguments.}

\item{ylim}{user defined limits in y direction.}

\item{subset}{which subset of the data should the correlation function be
calculated on?}

\item{...}{other options to pass to \code{\link[base:plot]{plot}}.}
}
\value{
a plot or a vector of \code{fun} applied at the lags.
}
\description{
Once a DSM has been fitted to data, this function can be used to check for
autocorrelation in the residuals.

\section{Details}{
 Within each \code{Transect.Label}, segments will be sorted
according to their \code{Segment.Label}s. This may require some time to get right
for your particular data. If one has multiple surveys where transects are
revisited, for example, one may want to make \code{Transect.Label} a unique
transect-survey identifier. Neither label need to be included in the model,
they must just be present in the \verb{$data} field in the model. This usually
means that they have to be in the segment data passed to \code{\link{dsm}}.

The current iteration of this function will only plot correlations nicely,
other things are up to you but you can get the function to return the data
(by assigning the result to an object).

If there are NA values in the residuals then the correlogram will not be
calculated. This usually occurs due to \code{NA} values in the covariates (so the
smoother will not have fitted values there). Code like
\code{any(is.na(dsm.obj$data))} might be helpful.
