\title{Observed versus expected diagnostics for fitted DSMs}
\usage{
obs_exp(model, covar, cut = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{a fitted \code{\link{dsm}} model object}

\item{covar}{covariate to aggregate by (\code{character})}

\item{cut}{vector of cut points to aggregate at. If not supplied, the unique
values of \code{covar} are used.}
}
\value{
\code{data.frame} with values of observed and expected counts.
}
\description{
Given a covariate, calculate the observed and expected counts for each
unique value of the covariate. This can be a useful goodness of fit check
for DSMs.
}
\details{
One strategy for model checking is to calculate observed and expected counts
at different aggregations of the variable. If these match well then the
model fit is good.

# example with the Gulf of Mexico dolphin data

hr.model <- ds(distdata, truncation=6000,

mod1 <- dsm(count~s(x,y), hr.model, segdata, obsdata)
}
