\usage{
dsm.var.prop(dsm.obj, pred.data, off.set, seglen.varname = "Effort",
  type.pred = "response")
}
\arguments{
\item{dsm.obj}{an object returned from running \code{\link{dsm}}.}

\item{pred.data}{either: a single prediction grid or list of prediction
grids. Each grid should be a \code{data.frame} with the same
columns as the original data.}

\item{off.set}{a a vector or list of vectors with as many elements as there
are in \code{pred.data}. Each vector is as long as the number of
rows in the corresponding element of \code{pred.data}. These give
the area associated with each prediction point.}

\item{seglen.varname}{name for the column which holds the segment length
(default value "Effort").}

\item{type.pred}{should the predictions be on the "response" or "link" scale?
(default "response").}
}
\value{

                     in \code{pred.data}. Diagonal elements are the

                       coefficients of the two models to see if there is a
                       large difference\cr

\description{
Rather than use a bootstrap to calculate the variance in a \code{dsm} model,
use the clever variance propogation trick from Williams et al. (2011).
}
\details{
The idea is to refit the spatial model but including the Hessian of the
offset as an extra term. Variance estimates using this new model can then
be used to calculate the variance of abundance estimates which incorporate
detection function uncertainty. Further mathematical details are given in
the paper in the references below.

Many prediction grids can be supplied by supplying a list of
\code{data.frame}s to the function.

Note that this routine is only useful if a detection function has been used in the DSM.

Based on (much more general) code from Mark Bravington and Sharon Hedley.

\examples{
\dontrun{
 library(Distance)
 library(dsm)

 # load the Gulf of Mexico dolphin data (see ?mexdolphins)
 data(mexdolphins)

 # fit a detection function and look at the summary
 hr.model <- ds(mexdolphins$distdata, max(mexdolphins$distdata$distance),
                key = "hr", adjustment = NULL)
 summary(hr.model)

 # fit a simple smooth of x and y
 mod1 <- dsm(N~s(x,y), hr.model, mexdolphins$segdata, mexdolphins$obsdata)

 # Calculate the offset...
 off.set <- 444*1000*1000

 # Calculate the variance
 mod1.var <- dsm.var.prop(mod1, mexdolphins$pred, off.set)

 # summary over the whole area in mexdolphins$pred

 # Plot a map of the CV
 #   need to format the prediction data with split
 mod1.var.map <- dsm.var.prop(mod1,
                 split(mexdolphins$pred,1:nrow(mexdolphins$pred)), off.set)
 plot(mod1.var.map)
