	abstract = {Conventional smoothing methods sometimes perform badly when used to smooth data over complex domains, by smoothing inappropriately across boundary features, such as peninsulas. Solutions to this smoothing problem tend to be computationally complex, and not to provide model smooth functions which are appropriate for incorporating as components of other models, such as generalized additive models, or mixed additive models. In this paper we propose a class of smoothers appropriate for smoothing over difficult regions of R2, which can be represented in terms of a low rank basis and one or two quadratic penalties. The key features of these smoothers are (i) that they do not {\textquoteleft}smooth across{\textquoteright} boundary features; (ii) that their representation in terms of a basis and penalties allows straightforward incorporation as components of GAMs, mixed models and other non-standard models; (iii) that smoothness selection for these model components is straightforward to accomplish in a computationally efficient manner via GCV, AIC or REML, for example; (iv) that their low rank means that their use is computationally efficient.},

  abstract = {Spatially explicit estimates of population density, together with appropriate estimates of uncertainty, are required in many management contexts. Density surface models (DSMs) are a two-stage approach for estimating spatially varying density from distance sampling data. First, detection probabilities---perhaps depending on covariates---are estimated based on details of individual encounters; next, local densities are estimated using a GAM, by fitting local encounter rates to location and/or spatially varying covariates while allowing for the estimated detectabilities. One criticism of DSMs has been that uncertainty from the two stages is not usually propagated correctly into the final variance estimates. We show how to reformulate a DSM so that the uncertainty in detection probability from the distance sampling stage (regardless of its complexity) is captured as an extra random effect in the GAM stage. In effect, we refit an approximation to the detection function model at the same time as fitting the spatial model. This allows straightforward computation of the overall variance via exactly the same software already needed to fit the GAM. A further extension allows for spatial variation in group size, which can be an important covariate for detectability as well as directly affecting abundance. We illustrate these models using point transect survey data of Island Scrub-Jays on Santa Cruz Island, CA, and harbour porpoise from the SCANS-II line transect survey of European waters.

 abstract = {In this article we give a general definition of residuals for regression models with independent responses. Our definition produces residuals that are exactly normal, apart from sampling variability in the estimated parameters, by inverting the fitted distribution function for each response value and finding the equivalent standard normal quantile. Our definition includes some randomization to achieve continuous residuals when the response variable is discrete. Quantile residuals are easily computed in computer packages such as SAS, S-Plus, GLIM, or LispStat, and allow residual analyses to be carried out in many commonly occurring situations in which the customary definitions of residuals fail. Quantile residuals are applied in this article to three example data sets.},
