	abstract = {Conventional smoothing methods sometimes perform badly when used to smooth data over complex domains, by smoothing inappropriately across boundary features, such as peninsulas. Solutions to this smoothing problem tend to be computationally complex, and not to provide model smooth functions which are appropriate for incorporating as components of other models, such as generalized additive models, or mixed additive models. In this paper we propose a class of smoothers appropriate for smoothing over difficult regions of R2, which can be represented in terms of a low rank basis and one or two quadratic penalties. The key features of these smoothers are (i) that they do not {\textquoteleft}smooth across{\textquoteright} boundary features; (ii) that their representation in terms of a basis and penalties allows straightforward incorporation as components of GAMs, mixed models and other non-standard models; (iii) that smoothness selection for these model components is straightforward to accomplish in a computationally efficient manner via GCV, AIC or REML, for example; (iv) that their low rank means that their use is computationally efficient.},

	title = {Reliable variance propagation for spatial density surface models},
	abstract = {Density Surface Models (DSMs) are two-stage models for estimating animal density from line-transect data. First, detectability is estimated by distance sampling, and then a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) is used to estimate animal density as a function of location and/or other spatially-varying environmental covariates. One criticism of DSMs has been that uncertainty from the two stages is not usually propagated correctly into the final variance estimates. We show how to reformulate a DSM so that the uncertainty in detection probability from the distance sampling stage (regardless of its complexity) is captured as a random effect in the GAM stage. This random effect acts as a quadratic approximation to the detection probability centred at the point estimate of detectability, effectively fitting the detection function at the same time as the spatial model. This allows straightforward computation of the overall variance via standard GAM machinery. A further extension allows for spatial variation in group size, which can be an important covariate for detectability. We illustrate these models using line transect survey data of minke whales and harbour porpoise from a visual line transect survey of European waters.},

 abstract = {In this article we give a general definition of residuals for regression models with independent responses. Our definition produces residuals that are exactly normal, apart from sampling variability in the estimated parameters, by inverting the fitted distribution function for each response value and finding the equivalent standard normal quantile. Our definition includes some randomization to achieve continuous residuals when the response variable is discrete. Quantile residuals are easily computed in computer packages such as SAS, S-Plus, GLIM, or LispStat, and allow residual analyses to be carried out in many commonly occurring situations in which the customary definitions of residuals fail. Quantile residuals are applied in this article to three example data sets.},
