#
#    dsm.predict - purpose to predict abundance within study area at locations
#                  away from the transects surveyed.
#
#  Arguments:
#     gam.model - fitted model object (created by previous call to gam())
#     newdata   - know as 'prediction.covariates.dat.r' in D6 DSM statement of 
#                 direction prediction grid data frame, spatially referenced 
#                 (latitude and longitude) covariates e.g., sea temperature, depth, 
#                 distance to shore, etc.
#     field     - logical indicating whether offset is provides as constant (False) 
#                 or field in grid dataframe (True)
#     off.set   - area of cells in prediction grid (newdata), provided by Distance
#                 Note covariates in this dataframe must have names *identical* 
#                 to variable names used in fitting the gam
#                 If entered between double quotes, will be a field named in 
#                 prediction grid, otherwise a numeric constant
#			         Assume if a constant comes in, it will already have had the link 
#                 transform applied, whereas if field, apply link fn.
#     silent    - Set to true when used in conjunction with variance bootstraps; in 
#                 this case we don't wish to see the abundance estimate printed
#                 This identical nature of the names in the model object and dataframe
#                 is not currently enforced; however, some code along the line of
#                 for (j in 1:length(names(newd))){
#                    print(any(i<-grep(names(newd)[[j]], 
#                      dimnames(attr(b$terms,"factors"))[[1]])))
#                 }              
#                 would perform some checking of this

#               Failure to have all covariates in 'newdata' results in message 
#               of this sort:
#                 Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : object "x2" not found
#                   In addition: Warning message:
#                   not all required variables have been supplied in newdata!
#                   in: predict.gam(b, newd, type = "response") 
#
#   Value:
#         produces one-dimensional array of predicted values (without se's)
#         as well as the call that generated this instance of the function

#   Functions used:  predict.gam() from package mgcv
#                    Note the default arguments in predict.gam()
#                    newdata.guaranteed=FALSE and

#                    seem believable; leave them at their defaults, *but*
#                    type="response" is not the default argument, and needs to be 
#                    specified
