Description: This library implements density surface modelling
       of line transect data, based on the methods of 
       Hedley et al. (2004).  Outputs are point and interval
       estimates of population abundance and density.
       Designed to be called from the software Distance, which
       is available from http://www.ruwpa.st-and.ac.uk/distance/
