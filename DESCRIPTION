Title: Density surface modelling of distance sampling data
LazyLoad: yes
Author: David L. Miller, Eric Rexstad, Louise Burt, Mark V. Bravington,
    Sharon Hedley.
Description: This library implements density surface modelling of line
    transect data, based on the methods of Hedley et al. (2004). Some
    recent developments in the literature have also be incorporated.
    Outputs are point and interval estimates of population abundance
    and density.
    Please note that this version of dsm WILL NOT work with the Windows
    package DISTANCE earlier than version 6.2. For a version that works with
    DISTANCE 6.1, please go to:
