LazyLoad: yes
Author: Eric Rexstad, Louise Burt, David Miller
Description: This library implements density surface modelling of line
    transect data, based on the methods of Hedley et al. (2004).
    Outputs are point and interval estimates of population abundance
    and density. Designed to be called from the software Distance,
    which is available from http://www.ruwpa.st-and.ac.uk/distance/
