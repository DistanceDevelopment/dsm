# What is `dsm`?

`dsm` provides a Generalized Additive Model (GAM)-based approach to calculate spatially-explicit estimates of animal abundance from distance sampling (also presence/absence and strip transect) data. Several utility functions are provided for model checking, plotting and variance estimation.

# Using `dsm`

A quick introduction to how to use the package [can be found on the distance sampling website](http://distancesampling.org/R/vignettes/mexico-analysis.html).
