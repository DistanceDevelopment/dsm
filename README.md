# What is `dsm`?

`dsm` provides a Generalized Additive Model (GAM)-based approach to calculate spatially-explicit estimates of animal abundance from distance sampling (also presence/absence and strip transect) data. Several utility functions are provided for model checking, plotting and variance estimation.

Open Access paper describing the methods: [Miller, DL, ML Burt, EA Rexstad and L Thomas (2013). Spatial models for distance sampling data: recent developments and future directions. Methods in Ecology and Evolution.](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12105)

# Using `dsm`

Examples of how to use `dsm` and other distance sampling R packages are available at [examples.distancesampling.org](http://examples.distancesampling.org).
